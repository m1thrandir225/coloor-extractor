The whole purpose this was made was because I needed a way to extract colors, and node-vibrant doesn't work in a Deno environment. So I made this.

## For anyone looking to use this

If the link is not live, clone it and publish it to vercel, then just call {url}/api/get-colors?url=... and it will return a JSON object with the colors.
